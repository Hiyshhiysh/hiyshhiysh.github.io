        <h1>"Help! This mod doesn't work!"</h1>
        <strong>Okay, you're probably here because you can't figure out how to get those pesky mods working.</strong>
        <p>Fear not! I've created a list of many common issues when installing mods and how to solve them. This should hopefully save both you and everyone at CSS some time! Anyway, let's get started.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Mods still zipped</h2>
        <p>Starting off, the mods must be unzipped before they can work. If your mod is still a zip file, go to file explorer and find the file. Then, right-click it, select Extract All, select Browse and navigate to your ovlData folder.</p>
        <p>Select Extract and wait for the process to finish. The mod should now be installed.</p>

        <h2>2. Incorrectly named folders</h2>
        <p>Mods will not work if the folders for the mods are not named correctly. An obvious red flag is when the folder name has a number in brackets at the end. If this is the case, just remove them; this will probably fix the issue.</p>
        <p>If you're still unsure on what the folder's name should be, open the folder and open the file named 'Manifest.xml'. In this file should be a list of properties. Between two tags labelled <code>&lt;Name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;\Name&gt;</code> will be the intended name for the folder.</p>

        <h2>3. Double Stacking</h2>
        <p>Another common issue, mods will not work if thir folders are 'Double-stacked'. </p>
